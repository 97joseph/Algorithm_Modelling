Simple Modelling

This project is designed to give you more experience programming in C and using the Unix environment. Your task will be to write one program that implements a simple machine-learningalgorithm. This will require file I/O, dynamic memory allocation, and correctly implementing anmoderately complex algorithm.Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly used to provide services, such as face recog-nition in photographs, spelling correction, automated translation, and predicting what YouTubevideos you might want to watch next. Implementing a full ML algorithm is beyond the scope of thiscourse, so you will implement a “one shot” learning algorithm that uses historical data to predicthouse prices based on particular attributes.

For example, a house might havex1bedrooms,x2bathrooms,x3square footage, and be built inyearx4. If we had appropriate weights, we could estimate the price of the houseywith the formulay=w0+w1x1+w2x2+w3x3+w4x4.(1)The goal of one-shot learning is
